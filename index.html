    <h2 class="entry-title">Learning HTML</h2>

    <p class="entry-date"><em>Published on October 25, 2024</em></p>

    <p class="entry-text">Starting out as a programmer has been quite an adventure! I began with basic programming concepts in HTML like Text Emphasis, lists, and accessibility in HTML. These concepts were initially confusing, but with each day, I learned a bit more and gained confidence.</p>

    <p class="entry-text">One of the biggest challenges I faced was understanding <strong>logic flow</strong>â€”how each line of code interacts with the next. After several hours of practice and experimenting with small projects, I finally got the hang of it. Now, I'm excited to dive deeper into programming languages!</p>

    <h2 class="entry-title">Learning CSS</h2>

    <p class="entry-date"><em>Published on October 25, 2024</em></p>

    <p class="entry-text">After understanding the HTML basics, I moved on to learning CSS. HTML gives structure to web pages, while CSS makes them visually appealing. Learning how to structure content and apply styles has been a lot of fun!</p>

    <p class="entry-text">Some of the CSS properties I've enjoyed using include <strong>font-family</strong>, <strong>font-size</strong>, <strong>color</strong>, and <strong>font-style</strong>. With these, I can control the look and feel of my website and make it more engaging for visitors.</p>
